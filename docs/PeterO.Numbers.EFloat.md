## PeterO.Numbers.EFloat

    public sealed class EFloat :
        System.IComparable,
        System.IEquatable

Represents an arbitrary-precision binary floating-point number. (The "E" stands for "extended", meaning that instances of this class can be values other than numbers proper, such as infinity and not-a-number.) Each number consists of an integer mantissa (significand) and an integer exponent, both arbitrary-precision. The value of the number equals mantissa (significand) * 2^exponent. This class also supports values for negative zero, not-a-number (NaN) values, and infinity.Passing a signaling NaN to any arithmetic operation shown here will signal the flag FlagInvalid and return a quiet NaN, even if another operand to that operation is a quiet NaN, unless noted otherwise.

Passing a quiet NaN to any arithmetic operation shown here will return a quiet NaN, unless noted otherwise.

Unless noted otherwise,passing a null arbitrary-precision binary float argument to any method here will throw an exception.

When an arithmetic operation signals the flag FlagInvalid, FlagOverflow, or FlagDivideByZero, it will not throw an exception too, unless the operation's trap is enabled in the precision context (see EContext's Traps property).

An arbitrary-precision binary float value can be serialized in one of the following ways:

 * By calling the toString() method. However, not all strings can be converted back to an arbitrary-precision binary float without loss, especially if the string has a fractional part.

 * By calling the UnsignedMantissa, Exponent, and IsNegative properties, and calling the IsInfinity, IsQuietNaN, and IsSignalingNaN methods. The return values combined will uniquely identify a particular arbitrary-precision binary float value.

If an operation requires creating an intermediate value that might be too big to fit in memory (or might require more than 2 gigabytes of memory to store -- due to the current use of a 32-bit integer internally as a length), the operation may signal an invalid-operation flag and return not-a-number (NaN). In certain rare cases, the CompareTo method may throw OutOfMemoryException (called OutOfMemoryError in Java) in the same circumstances.

<b>Thread safety</b>

Instances of this class are immutable, so they are inherently safe for use by multiple threads. Multiple instances of this object with the same properties are interchangeable, so they should not be compared using the "==" operator (which might only check if each side of the operator is the same instance).

<b>Comparison considerations</b>

This class's natural ordering (under the CompareTo method) is not consistent with the Equals method. This means that two values that compare as equal under the CompareTo method might not be equal under the Equals method. The CompareTo method compares the mathematical values of the two instances passed to it (and considers two different NaN values as equal), while two instances with the same mathematical value, but different exponents, will be considered unequal under the Equals method.

        PeterO.Numbers.EContext ctx);

Returns a binary float with the same value but a new exponent.Note that this is not always the same as rounding to a given number of binary digit places, since it can fail if the difference between this value's exponent and the desired exponent is too big, depending on the maximum precision. If rounding to a number of binary digit places is desired, it's better to use the RoundToExponent and RoundToIntegral methods instead.

<b>Remark:</b>This method can be used to implement ixed-point binary arithmetic, in which each binary float has a ixed number of digits after the radix point. The following code xample returns a fixed-point number with up to 20 digits before nd exactly 5 digits after the radix point:

    // After performing arithmetic operations, adjust  // the number to 5
    digits after the radix point number = number.Quantize(-5,  // five
    digits after the radix point EContext.ForPrecision(25)  // 25-digit
    precision);

A fixed-point binary arithmetic in which no digits come after the radix point (a desired exponent of 0) is considered an "integer arithmetic".

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>desiredExponentInt</i>: The desired exponent for the result. The exponent is the number of fractional digits in the result, expressed as a negative number.

A value of 0 rounds the number to an integer.

 * <i>ctx</i>: An arithmetic context to control precision and rounding of the result. If  `HasFlags` of the context is true, ill also store the flags resulting from the operation (the flags re in addition to the pre-existing flags). Can be null, in which ase the default rounding mode is HalfEven.

<b>Return Value:</b>

A binary float with the same value as this object but with the exponent changed. Signals FlagInvalid and returns not-a-number (NaN) if this object is infinity, if the rounded result can't fit the given precision, or if the context defines an exponent range and the given exponent is outside that range.

If rounding to a number of binary digit places is desired, it's better to use the RoundToExponent and RoundToIntegral methods instead.

<b>Remark:</b> This method can be used to implement fixed-point binary arithmetic, in which a fixed number of digits come after the radix point. A fixed-point binary arithmetic in which no digits come after the radix point (a desired exponent of 0) is considered an "integer arithmetic".

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>otherValue</i>: A binary float containing the desired exponent of the result. The mantissa (significand) is ignored. The exponent is the number of fractional digits in the result, expressed as a negative number. Can also be positive, which eliminates lower-order places from the number. For example, -3 means round to the sixteenth (10b^-3, 0.0001b), and 3 means round to the sixteen-place (10b^3, 1000b). A value of 0 rounds the number to an integer.

 * <i>ctx</i>: An arithmetic context to control precision and rounding of the result. If  `HasFlags`  of the context is true, will also store the flags resulting from the operation (the flags are in addition to the pre-existing flags). Can be null, in which case the default rounding mode is HalfEven.

<b>Return Value:</b>

A binary float with the same value as this object but with the exponent changed. Signals FlagInvalid and returns not-a-number (NaN) if the result can't fit the given precision without rounding, or if the arithmetic context defines an exponent range and the given exponent is outside that range.

        PeterO.Numbers.EInteger desiredExponent,
        PeterO.Numbers.EContext ctx);

Returns a binary float with the same value but a new exponent.Note that this is not always the same as rounding to a given number of binary digit places, since it can fail if the difference between this value's exponent and the desired exponent is too big, depending on the maximum precision. If rounding to a number of binary digit places is desired, it's better to use the RoundToExponent and RoundToIntegral methods instead.

<b>Remark:</b>This method can be used to implement ixed-point binary arithmetic, in which each binary float has a ixed number of digits after the radix point. The following code xample returns a fixed-point number with up to 20 digits before nd exactly 5 digits after the radix point:

    // After performing arithmetic operations, adjust  // the number to 5
    digits after the radix point number = number.Quantize(
    EInteger.FromInt32(-5),  // five digits after the radix point
    EContext.ForPrecision(25)  // 25-digit precision);

A fixed-point binary arithmetic in which no digits come after the radix point (a desired exponent of 0) is considered an "integer arithmetic".

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>desiredExponent</i>: The desired exponent for the result. The exponent is the number of fractional digits in the result, expressed as a negative number.

A value of 0 rounds the number to an integer.
