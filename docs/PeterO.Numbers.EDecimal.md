## PeterO.Numbers.EDecimal

    public sealed class EDecimal :
        System.IComparable,
        System.IEquatable

Represents an arbitrary-precision decimal floating-point number. (The "E" stands for "extended", meaning that instances of this class can be values other than numbers proper, such as infinity and not-a-number.)<b>About decimal arithmetic</b>

Decimal (base-10) arithmetic, such as that provided by this class, is appropriate for calculations involving such real-world data as prices and other sums of money, tax rates, and measurements. These calculations often involve multiplying or dividing one decimal with another decimal, or performing other operations on decimal numbers. Many of these calculations also rely on rounding behavior in which the result after rounding is a decimal number (for example, multiplying a price by a premium rate, then rounding, should result in a decimal amount of money).

On the other hand, most implementations of  `float` and `double` , including in C# and Java, store numbers in a binary base-2) floating-point format and use binary floating-point rithmetic. Many decimal numbers can't be represented exactly in inary floating-point format (regardless of its length). Applying inary arithmetic to numbers intended to be decimals can sometimes ead to unintuitive results, as is shown in the description for the romDouble() method of this class.

<b>About EDecimal instances</b>

Each instance of this class consists of an integer mantissa (significand) and an integer exponent, both arbitrary-precision. The value of the number equals mantissa (significand) * 10^exponent.

The mantissa (significand) is the value of the digits that make up a number, ignoring the decimal point and exponent. For example, in the number 2356.78, the mantissa (significand) is 235678. The exponent is where the "floating" decimal point of the number is located. A positive exponent means "move it to the right", and a negative exponent means "move it to the left." In the example 2, 356.78, the exponent is -2, since it has 2 decimal places and the decimal point is "moved to the left by 2." Therefore, in the arbitrary-precision decimal representation, this number would be stored as 235678 * 10^-2.

The mantissa (significand) and exponent format preserves trailing zeros in the number's value. This may give rise to multiple ways to store the same value. For example, 1.00 and 1 would be stored differently, even though they have the same value. In the first case, 100 * 10^-2 (100 with decimal point moved left by 2), and in the second case, 1 * 10^0 (1 with decimal point moved 0).

This class also supports values for negative zero, not-a-number (NaN) values, and infinity. <b>Negative zero</b>is enerally used when a negative number is rounded to 0; it has the ame mathematical value as positive zero. <b>Infinity</b>is enerally used when a non-zero number is divided by zero, or when a ery high or very low number can't be represented in a given xponent range. <b>Not-a-number</b>is generally used to signal rrors.

This class implements the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification version 1.70 (except part of chapter 6): `http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html`

<b>Errors and Exceptions</b>

Passing a signaling NaN to any arithmetic operation shown here will signal the flag FlagInvalid and return a quiet NaN, even if another operand to that operation is a quiet NaN, unless noted otherwise.

Passing a quiet NaN to any arithmetic operation shown here will return a quiet NaN, unless noted otherwise. Invalid operations will also return a quiet NaN, as stated in the individual methods.

Unless noted otherwise,passing a null arbitrary-precision decimal argument to any method here will throw an exception.

When an arithmetic operation signals the flag FlagInvalid, FlagOverflow, or FlagDivideByZero, it will not throw an exception too, unless the flag's trap is enabled in the arithmetic context (see EContext's Traps property).

If an operation requires creating an intermediate value that might be too big to fit in memory (or might require more than 2 gigabytes of memory to store -- due to the current use of a 32-bit integer internally as a length), the operation may signal an invalid-operation flag and return not-a-number (NaN). In certain rare cases, the CompareTo method may throw OutOfMemoryException (called OutOfMemoryError in Java) in the same circumstances.

<b>Serialization</b>

An arbitrary-precision decimal value can be serialized (converted to a stable format) in one of the following ways:

 * By calling the toString() method, which will always return distinct strings for distinct arbitrary-precision decimal values.

 * By calling the UnsignedMantissa, Exponent, and IsNegative properties, and calling the IsInfinity, IsQuietNaN, and IsSignalingNaN methods. The return values combined will uniquely identify a particular arbitrary-precision decimal value.

<b>Thread safety</b>

Instances of this class are immutable, so they are inherently safe for use by multiple threads. Multiple instances of this object with the same properties are interchangeable, so they should not be compared using the "==" operator (which might only check if each side of the operator is the same instance).

<b>Comparison considerations</b>

This class's natural ordering (under the CompareTo method) is not consistent with the Equals method. This means that two values that compare as equal under the CompareTo method might not be equal under the Equals method. The CompareTo method compares the mathematical values of the two instances passed to it (and considers two different NaN values as equal), while two instances with the same mathematical value, but different exponents, will be considered unequal under the Equals method.

<b>Forms of numbers</b>

There are several other types of numbers that are mentioned in this class and elsewhere in this documentation. For reference, they are specified here.

<b>Unsigned integer</b>: An integer that's always 0 or reater, with the following maximum values:

 * 8-bit unsigned integer, or <i>byte</i>: 255.

 * 16-bit unsigned integer: 65535.

 * 32-bit unsigned integer: (2 <sup>32</sup> -1).

 * 64-bit unsigned integer: (2 <sup>64</sup> -1).

<b>Signed integer</b>: An integer in <i>two's complement form</i>, with the following ranges:

 * 8-bit signed integer: -128 to 127.

 * 16-bit signed integer: -32768 to 32767.

 * 32-bit signed integer: -2 <sup>31</sup>to (2 <sup>31</sup>- 1).

 * 64-bit signed integer: -2 <sup>63</sup>to (2 <sup>63</sup>- 1).

<b>Two's complement form</b>: In <i>two' s-complement form</i>, positive numbers have the highest (most significant) bit et to zero, and negative numbers have that bit (and all bits eyond) set to one. To store a negative number, decrease its bsolute value by 1 and swap the bits of the resulting umber.

<b>64-bit floating-point number</b>: A 64-bit binary loating-point number, in the form <i>significand</i>* 2<sup><i>exponent</i></sup>. The significand is 53 bits long Precision) and the exponent ranges from -1074 (EMin) to 971 EMax). The number is stored in the following format (commonly alled the IEEE 754 format):

    |C|BBB...BBB|AAAAAA...AAAAAA|

 * A. Low 52 bits (Precision minus 1 bits): Lowest bits of the significand.

 * B. Next 11 bits: Exponent area:

 * If all bits are ones, this value is infinity if all bits in area A are zeros, or not-a-number (NaN) otherwise.

 * If all bits are zeros, this is a subnormal number. The exponent is EMin and the highest bit of the significand is zero.

 * If any other number, the exponent is this value reduced by 1, then raised by EMin, and the highest bit of the significand is one.

 * C. Highest bit: If one, this is a negative number.

The elements described above are in the same order as the order of each bit of each element, that is, either most significant first or least significant first.

<b>32-bit floating-point number</b>: A 32-bit binary number hich is stored similarly to a <i>64-bit floating-point number</i>, except that:

 * Precision is 24 bits.

 * EMin is -149.

 * EMax is 104.

 * A. The low 23 bits (Precision minus 1 bits) are the lowest bits of the significand.

 * B. The next 8 bits are the exponent area.

 * C. If the highest bit is one, this is a negative number.

<b>.NET Framework decimal</b> : A 128-bit decimal floating-point number, in the form <i>significand</i> * 10 <sup>-<i>scale</i></sup>, where the scale ranges from 0 to 28. The umber is stored in the following format:

 * Low 96 bits are the significand, as a 96-bit unsigned integer (all 96-bit values are allowed, up to (2 <sup>96</sup>-1)).

 * Next 16 bits are unused.

 * Next 8 bits are the scale, stored as an 8-bit unsigned integer.

 * Next 7 bits are unused.

 * If the highest bit is one, it's a negative number.

The elements described above are in the same order as the order of each bit of each element, that is, either most significant first or least significant first.

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>divisor</i>: An arbitrary-precision decimal number to divide by.

 * <i>desiredExponentInt</i>: The desired exponent. A negative number places the cutoff point to the right of the usual decimal point (so a negative number means the number of decimal places to round to). A positive number places the cutoff point to the left of the usual decimal point.

 * <i>ctx</i>: An arithmetic context object to control the rounding mode to use if the result must be scaled down to have the same exponent as this value. If the precision given in the context is other than 0, calls the Quantize method with both arguments equal to the result of the operation (and can signal FlagInvalid and return NaN if the result doesn't fit the given precision). If `HasFlags`  of the context is true, will also store the flags resulting from the operation (the flags are in addition to the pre-existing flags).

### FromSingle

    public static PeterO.Numbers.EDecimal FromSingle(
        float flt);

Creates a decimal number from a 32-bit binary floating-point number. This method computes the exact value of the floating point number, not an approximation, as is often the case by converting the floating point number to a string first. Remember, though, that the exact value of a 32-bit binary floating-point number is not always the value that results when passing a literal decimal number (for example, calling `ExtendedDecimal.FromSingle(0.1f)`  ), since not all decimal numbers can be converted to exact binary numbers (in the example given, the resulting arbitrary-precision decimal will be the the value of the closest "float" to 0.1, not 0.1 exactly).

Returns a decimal number with the same value but a new exponent.Note that this is not always the same as rounding to a given number of decimal places, since it can fail if the difference between this value's exponent and the desired exponent is too big, depending on the maximum precision. If rounding to a number of decimal places is desired, it's better to use the RoundToExponent and RoundToIntegral methods instead.

<b>Remark:</b>This method can be used to implement ixed-point decimal arithmetic, in which each decimal number has a ixed number of digits after the decimal point. The following code xample returns a fixed-point number with up to 20 digits before nd exactly 5 digits after the decimal point:

    // After performing arithmetic operations, adjust  // the number to 5
    digits after the decimal point number = number.Quantize(-5,  // five
    digits after the decimal point EContext.ForPrecision(25)  // 25-digit
    precision);

A fixed-point decimal arithmetic in which no digits come after the decimal point (a desired exponent of 0) is considered an "integer arithmetic".

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>desiredExponentInt</i>: The desired exponent for the result. The exponent is the number of fractional digits in the result, expressed as a negative number. Can also be positive, which eliminates lower-order places from the number. For example, -3 means round to the thousandth (10^-3, 0.0001), and 3 means round to the thousand (10^3, 1000). A value of 0 rounds the number to an integer.

 * <i>ctx</i>: An arithmetic context to control precision and rounding of the result. If  `HasFlags` of the context is true, ill also store the flags resulting from the operation (the flags re in addition to the pre-existing flags). Can be null, in which ase the default rounding mode is HalfEven.

<b>Return Value:</b>

A decimal number with the same value as this object but with the exponent changed. Signals FlagInvalid and returns not-a-number (NaN) if this object is infinity, if the rounded result can't fit the given precision, or if the context defines an exponent range and the given exponent is outside that range.

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>desiredExponentInt</i>: The desired exponent for the result. The exponent is the number of fractional digits in the result, expressed as a negative number. Can also be positive, which eliminates lower-order places from the number. For example, -3 means round to the thousandth (10^-3, 0.0001), and 3 means round to the thousand (10^3, 1000). A value of 0 rounds the number to an integer.

 * <i>rounding</i>: A rounding mode to use in case the result needs to be rounded to fit the given exponent.

<b>Return Value:</b>

A decimal number with the same value as this object but with the exponent changed. Returns not-a-number (NaN) if this object is infinity, or if the rounding mode is ERounding.None and the result is not exact.

        PeterO.Numbers.EDecimal otherValue,
        PeterO.Numbers.EContext ctx);

If rounding to a number of decimal places is desired, it's better to use the RoundToExponent and RoundToIntegral methods instead.

<b>Remark:</b> This method can be used to implement fixed-point decimal arithmetic, in which a fixed number of digits come after the decimal point. A fixed-point decimal arithmetic in which no digits come after the decimal point (a desired exponent of 0) is considered an "integer arithmetic".

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>otherValue</i>: A decimal number containing the desired exponent of the result. The mantissa (significand) is ignored. The exponent is the number of fractional digits in the result, expressed as a negative number. Can also be positive, which eliminates lower-order places from the number. For example, -3 means round to the sixteenth (10b^-3, 0.0001b), and 3 means round to the sixteen-place (10b^3, 1000b). A value of 0 rounds the number to an integer.

 * <i>ctx</i>: An arithmetic context to control precision and rounding of the result. If  `HasFlags`  of the context is true, will also store the flags resulting from the operation (the flags are in addition to the pre-existing flags). Can be null, in which case the default rounding mode is HalfEven.

<b>Return Value:</b>

A decimal number with the same value as this object but with the exponent changed. Signals FlagInvalid and returns not-a-number (NaN) if the result can't fit the given precision without rounding, or if the arithmetic context defines an exponent range and the given exponent is outside that range.

### Quantize

    public PeterO.Numbers.EDecimal Quantize(
        PeterO.Numbers.EInteger desiredExponent,
        PeterO.Numbers.EContext ctx);

Returns a decimal number with the same value but a new exponent.Note that this is not always the same as rounding to a given number of decimal places, since it can fail if the difference between this value's exponent and the desired exponent is too big, depending on the maximum precision. If rounding to a number of decimal places is desired, it's better to use the RoundToExponent and RoundToIntegral methods instead.

<b>Remark:</b>This method can be used to implement ixed-point decimal arithmetic, in which each decimal number has a ixed number of digits after the decimal point. The following code xample returns a fixed-point number with up to 20 digits before nd exactly 5 digits after the decimal point:

    // After performing arithmetic operations, adjust
    // the number to 5
    // digits after the decimal point
    number = number.Quantize(
    EInteger.FromInt32(-5),  // five digits after the decimal point
    EContext.ForPrecision(25)  // 25-digit precision);

A fixed-point decimal arithmetic in which no digits come after the decimal point (a desired exponent of 0) is considered an "integer arithmetic".

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>desiredExponent</i>: The desired exponent for the result. The exponent is the number of fractional digits in the result, expressed as a negative number. Can also be positive, which eliminates lower-order places from the number. For example, -3 means round to the thousandth (10^-3, 0.0001), and 3 means round to the thousand (10^3, 1000). A value of 0 rounds the number to an integer.

 * <i>ctx</i>: An arithmetic context to control precision and rounding of the result. If  `HasFlags` of the context is true, ill also store the flags resulting from the operation (the flags re in addition to the pre-existing flags). Can be null, in which ase the default rounding mode is HalfEven.

<b>Return Value:</b>

A decimal number with the same value as this object but with the exponent changed. Signals FlagInvalid and returns not-a-number (NaN) if this object is infinity, if the rounded result can't fit the given precision, or if the context defines an exponent range and the given exponent is outside that range.

<b>Parameters:</b>

 * <i>ctx</i>: An arithmetic context to control precision, rounding, and exponent range of the result.

Can be null, in which case the precision is unlimited and rounding isn't needed.

<b>Return Value:</b>

This value with trailing zeros removed. Note that if the result has a very high exponent and the context says to clamp high exponents, there may still be some trailing zeros in the mantissa (significand).

 * If the remainder's absolute value is less than half of the divisor's absolute value, the result has the same sign as this object and will be the distance to the closest multiple.

 * If the remainder's absolute value is more than half of the divisor' s absolute value, the result has the opposite sign of this object and will be the distance to the closest multiple.

 * If the remainder's absolute value is exactly half of the divisor's absolute value, the result has the opposite sign of this object if the quotient, rounded down, is odd, and has the same sign as this object if the quotient, rounded down, is even, and the result's absolute value is half of the divisor's absolute value.

 This function is also known as the "IEEE Remainder" function.

Unfortunately, in the .NET implementation, the return value of this method may be a quiet NaN even if a signaling NaN would otherwise be generated.
